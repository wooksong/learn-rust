# Mission 11 — AWS ad marker fixture

## Goal

Verify ad/cue tags are ignored while segment URIs with query strings are preserved.

## Red: test prompt

Fixture should return only `index_*.ts?m=...` lines.

## Rust focus

real-world HLS tags, robustness.

## 100-exercises references

- `02_basic_calculator/07_for`
- `06_ticket_management/02_vec`

## Green

Implement the smallest production change that satisfies the red prompt. Prefer simple, readable Rust over clever abstractions.

## Refactor

This prepares for practical downloader parsing.

## Compiler traps

- If a value must outlive the function input, return an owned type like `String` or `Vec<T>`.
- If async tasks complain about lifetimes, move owned values into the task.
- If type inference gets confusing, add explicit local variable types in tests first.


## Completion checklist

- [ ] I wrote the red test or test prompt before changing production code.
- [ ] I saw the test fail for the expected reason.
- [ ] I implemented the smallest green change.
- [ ] I refactored without changing behavior.
- [ ] I reviewed the Rust focus notes and linked 100-exercises references.
- [ ] I recorded any surprise, compiler error, or design decision in my notes.
- [ ] I ran the relevant check for this scope (`cargo test`, or explain why not yet).
